# Raycast - *Personal* Script Commands
These are some basic scripts I use with [Raycast Script Commands](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands).

I do a lot of tab hoarding in [Arc](https://arc.net/) Browser (I know that's not how it was intended to be used) while I do the opposite i.e. "inbox zero" when using either Firefox and Safari.

To make "inbox zero" work, I often have to ["transport"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34850429) individual tabs in Firefox or Safari to Arc for triaging later.
I adapted these scripts to allow me move any tab from Firefox or Safari to Arc.

* [`firefox-to-arc.applescript`](browsers/firefox-to-arc.applescript) is bound to `⌥` + `⌘` + `F` in Raycast;
* [`safari-to-arc.applescript`](browsers/safari-to-arc.applescript) is bound to `⌥` + `⌘` + `S` in Raycast.
